We're looking for posters that show what you are doing with our resources and how CHTC fits into your work!

* **Project scope**: What is the big research question you're trying to answer?
* **Progress**: What have you learned so far?
* **Future work**: What do you plan to investigate next? What can you do if we give you more compute?
* **Scale**: How much work can you get done with CHTC resources (CPU hours, number of simulations)?
* **Automation and workflows**: How did you automate your work? What strategies do you use to create your workflow?
* **Feedback**: What worked for you? What didn't work for you?

### Poster Dimensions
